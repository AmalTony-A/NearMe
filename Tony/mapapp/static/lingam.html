Agni Lingam is a sacred form of Lord Shiva, representing the element of fire. It is one of the Pancha Bhoota Sthalams, symbolizing the divine energy and transformative power of fire. Devotees believe that worshipping the Agni Lingam purifies the mind and soul.

Rituals and festivals here often involve lighting lamps and performing fire ceremonies, emphasizing the significance of fire in devotion and life. It is considered a powerful symbol of divine presence and protection.
