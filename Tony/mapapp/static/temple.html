Arunachaleshwar Temple, also known as Annamalaiyar Temple, is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, located at the base of Arunachala Hill in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu. It is one of the largest temples in India and is considered one of the Pancha Bhoota Stalas, representing the element of fire. The temple is renowned for its grand architecture, towering gopurams, and spiritual significance. Every year, lakhs of devotees gather here for the Karthigai Deepam festival, where a giant lamp is lit on the hilltop, symbolizing Lord Shiva's divine light.
