Vannati Cave is a small rock-cut cave located near Pavazhakundur in Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu. It is a lesser-known historical site, attracting visitors interested in quiet and peaceful places. The cave’s name suggests it may have had ancient paintings or inscriptions. Though not much is documented about its history, it reflects the region’s rich cultural heritage. Visitors can explore the cave after a short hike through the surrounding area. It is a calm spot, ideal for reflection and photography. Local guidance is helpful to reach the cave and understand its significance.
